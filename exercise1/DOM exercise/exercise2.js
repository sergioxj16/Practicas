/*****
 * DOM - Exercise 2
 * 
 * When a user clicks on a div inside the div.container element, add or remove (toggle) the "selected" CSS class,
 * but this time, ONLY 1 div can have the "selected" class activated (remove from other div elements if necessary)
 * 
 * The button#insert-before element will create a NEW div with the text in the input#text element 
 * (don't forget the click event on the new div) before the selected div or at the beginning of 
 * the div.container if none is selected
 * 
 * The button#insert-after element will do the same but add it AFTER the selected div or at the end
 * of the div.container if none is selected
 * 
 * The button#replace elemente will create a NEW DIV with the corresponding text and replace the selected div
 * with it. If none is selected do nothing.
 * 
 * The button#delete elemente will delete the selected div (do nothing if none is selected).
 * 
 * The button#clear elemente will remove everything inside the div.container element.
 * 
 * DON'T USE innerHTML!!!!
